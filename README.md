# DeepMind COVID-19 toolkits

This repository contains tools for working with COVID-19 data and forecasting.
It contains:

*   A [Python-based evaluation toolkit] for standardising the data format and
    comparison of COVID-19 forecasts.
*   A [starter codebase for creating machine-learning-based forecasting models],
    with reference implementations and training scripts, compatible with the
    evaluation toolkit. This codebase is built with Python and the reference
    implementations are written in [JAX].

Please see the links above for documentation and installation instructions.

If you use our codebase, please cite our work as (TODO).
